# This is an example article

It uses LaTeX cite-keys -- for example [1]  
-- that are then later replaced by cite indices.

Another citation is inserted here [2].  

Multiple citations in a cite command are also supported.  
So, instead of using separate citation commands like [2][3][4], 
you could use a citekey with comma-separated entries as shown here [2-4],  
here [1-3]  
or here [2,4].
