# This is an example article

It uses LaTeX cite-keys -- for example \cite{Stone1974}  
-- that are then later replaced by cite indices.

Another citation is inserted here \cite{Sampson2016}.  

Multiple citations in a cite command are also supported.  
So, instead of using separate citation commands like \cite{Sampson2016}\cite{Salzberg1997}\cite{Cawley2010}, 
you could use a citekey with comma-separated entries as shown here \cite{Sampson2016,Salzberg1997,Cawley2010},  
here \cite{Stone1974,Sampson2016,Salzberg1997}  
or here \cite{Sampson2016,Cawley2010}.
