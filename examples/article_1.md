# This is an example article

It uses LaTeX cite-keys -- for example \cite{Stone1974} -- that are then later replaced by cite indices.

Another citation is inserted here \cite{Sampson2016}.

Multiple citations in a cite command are currently not supported and may produce undesired results. Use separate citation commands like \cite{Sampson2016}\cite{Salzberg1997}\cite{Cawley2010} instead.
